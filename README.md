Human Resource Analytics is the methodical collection, analysis, and interpretation of HR data to assist in the improvement of performance at organizations and in making better strategic decisions. Through the advanced capability of the analytical methods, HR analytics converts raw HR data into actionable insights that enable the organizations to further optimize their workforce management practices and align HR initiatives with broader business objectives.

The rationale for HR Analytics is the growing complexity of today's business environment and an increasing dependence on human capital to drive organizational outcomes. Though the organizations may already have vast amounts of HR data, having access to this data alone does not provide meaningful insights. It bridges the gap by furnishing them with the necessary tools and methodologies to extract actionable insights out of HR data for addressing pressing business challenges such as talent retention, recruitment optimization, and performance management.

Employee Attrition is the separation of employees from the organizations in which they work, through resignation, retirement, or other reasons. Usually, it is a functionally unintentional result within organizational perimeters, where negative factors such as increased recruitment costs, the loss of institutional knowledge, and the decline of morale among remaining employees all combine to affect the performance of the organization. Understanding the drivers of employee attrition-ergo, mitigating the impact of this organizational plague-requires proper strategies aimed at maintaining a stable and productive workforce to be sought by the organization.

Some major steps of the HR Analytics process include:

1. Data Collection: The collection of relevant data, which might relate-in a general context-relate to employee demographics, performance metrics, and turnover rates.

2. Data Preparation: Cleaning of data collected, then organizing and standardizing for precision and consistency.

3. Data Analysis: Using advanced data analysis techniques, one can come across patterns and trends in this data.

4. Insight Generation: Actionable insights and recommendations can be extracted from these analyses.

5. Decision Making: To implement strategies in ways that are data-driven to realize maximum performance from the workforce in achieving organizational objectives.
